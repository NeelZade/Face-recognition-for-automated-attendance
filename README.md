## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

You will need:

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`opencv-python` and possibly `opencv-contrib-python`)
* Other Python libraries such as `numpy`, `os`, `json` etc.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Here‚Äôs how to use the project from scratch:

1. **Dataset creation**
   Run:

   ```bash
   python facedataset.py
   ```

   Follow prompts to enter user ID and name. The script will capture images and save them; `labels.json` will be updated.

2. **Training**
   After you have enough face images in your dataset:

   ```bash
   python facetrainer.py
   ```

   This will train the recognizer and save it under `trainer/`.

3. **Recognition & Attendance**
   Run:

   ```bash
   python facerecong.py
   ```

   The system uses the webcam to recognize faces in real time. If recognition confidence is good (below a threshold), presence is marked; otherwise the face is marked ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration & Thresholds

* The file `config.json` stores settings such as the confidence threshold (the maximum allowed ‚Äúdistance‚Äù or error for recognizing a face).
* Use the `confidence_over_time.png` graph to see how confidence scores vary. This helps in choosing a good threshold value.
* Adjust threshold in `config.json` as per your environment (camera quality, lighting etc.).

---

## üìã Notes & Suggestions

* Ensure good lighting and face orientation when capturing dataset images ‚Äî more diverse poses improves recognition accuracy.
* Make sure Haar Cascade XML file (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) is present and accessible.
* The dataset folder structure, names, and the mapping between IDs & person names in `labels.json` must be consistent.

---

## üîß Potential Improvements

* Add GUI for face registration and attendance marking.
* Use more advanced face detection / recognition (e.g. DNN-based or deep learning models) to improve accuracy.
* Store attendance logs (e.g. timestamp + user) to file or database.
* Improve error handling & user feedback.
* If many users, consider optimizing dataset/training or using incremental learning.
